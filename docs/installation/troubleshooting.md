## Admin Tasks

### Update a user's role

**Background:** Permissions are now granted through RBAC. When someone changes departments, you may need to adjust their role so that the UI and API enforce the right access.

**Solution:** Navigate to **Settings → User Management**, edit the user, and update their role (Owner, Admin, Financial Manager, User). Changes take effect immediately — no manual database queries are required.
