# Setup a development environment

This document will guide you on how to setup a local development environment of MicroPowerManager (MPM).

In a local development environment

- the backend is served under <http://localhost:8000>
- the frontend is served under <http://localhost:8001>

## Preamble

This guide requires a Unix-like environment. Supported platforms include:

1. macOS: Any recent version of macOS (13 Ventura or later)
2. various Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)
3. Windows with [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

**For Windows users:**

- Please ensure you have WSL2 installed and properly configured before proceeding.
- Please ensure you are running Docker Desktop in WSL2 mode.
- When opening the repository in VS Code ensure to open in WSL2 mode (for example by navigating to the source code in WSL2 terminal and running `code .`)

**For all users:**

This document assumes that you have a basic understanding of how to use the command line.
You should be familiar with common Unix commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, and how to edit text files using a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Before proceeding, ensure you can open a terminal (Terminal app on macOS, terminal emulator on Linux, or WSL2 terminal on Windows) and run basic commands.

## Pre-requisites

- A docker container runtime with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (for example [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)).
  Make sure to configure at least 4GB of memory and 50GB disk (more doesn't hurt either) to the Docker Virtual Machine (VM).
- Working installation of [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A Text editor (While you can use any text editor you're comfortable with, we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for this project)

## Installation

1. `git`-clone the repository
2. Build and run the Docker containers with `docker compose up`
3. To access the local development instance of MicroPowerManager open <http://localhost:8001/> in a web browser.

## Seeding the database

> [!INFO]
>
> When you run the application for the first time, you can explore a vanilla MicroPowerManager instance where you can register new users and tenants.
>
> However, for a better development flow it is generally recommended to seed the local development environment with demo data.

To seed the database with Demo data, run:

```bash
docker exec -it backend-dev bash
php artisan db:seed
```

Log in to the application using the following credentials:

```sh
username: demo_company_admin@example.com
password: 123123
```

The Demo Company protected page password of this company is `123123`.

## Generating transaction data

To generate transaction and ticket for the Demo Company data, run:

```sh
php artisan demo:create-data 250
php artisan demo:create-data --type=ticket 25
```

This commands will create 250 transactions and 25 tickets within the past 30 days respectively.
It can be run multiple times to generate more data as required.

## Reseting the Demo data

> [!WARNING]
>
> Resetting the Demo data will remove all data from the Demo tenant.
> Any changes to the Demo data (for example created users, cluster or appliances) will be lost.

If you wish reset the Demo data setup to the default setup, run:

```sh
docker exec -it backend-dev bash
php artisan migrate-tenant:drop-demo-company
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

This can be helpful if

- Your sample setup got very messy and you wish to have a clean data basis for your work
- New Demo data seeders got added in the upstream code base and you wish to run them

## Advanced development environment

The above instructions describe how to set up a simple local environment of MicroPowerManager.
This is great for exploring the project both by interacting with the app and potentially some smaller code changes.

However, if you are considering to **contribute to MicroPowerManager** code base it is recommended to set up some additional steps and tools for developer's convienience.

We describe an example set up that has proven to work well based on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Configurations for a different editor will work a like.

### Local PHP installation

For local development and editor integration it can be helpful to have a local instance of PHP.
This will allow you to run composer scripts like `phpstan-analyse` without the need to use Docker.

These steps are highly dependant on your system.

For example using `brew` on MacOS

```sh
brew install php@8.2
pecl install redis
```

Alternatively [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) can be used.

### Linter configuration

The project uses various linters to ensure a consitent code base across the project.
The exact linter configuration can be found here: [`.github/worksflows`](https://github.com/EnAccess/micropowermanager/tree/main/.github/workflows).

Install the following linter and auto-formatter extensions

- [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- [PHP CS Fixer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=junstyle.php-cs-fixer)
- [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client)
- [Prettier - Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

### API client

We maintain a handful of API collections to interact with the backend of MPM.
You can find the collections in [`collections`](https://github.com/EnAccess/micropowermanager/tree/main/collections) folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, not every API of MPM is covered by a collection.
> Contributions to increase the coverage are welcome :pray:

- Install [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/)

To interact with APIs that require authorisation

- Select `Local Development` as environment
- Execute the `Login` API call

![Bruno](/screenshots/bruno.png)

This will save the Authorisation Bearer token into your local variables and use them in consecutive API calls.

### SQL editor

When working with the backend part of the code an SQL editor and database manager application can be extremely helpful to visualise and explore the underlying database.

Choose your favorite SQL editor with support for MariaDB (or MySQL).
For example

- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)
- [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/)
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)

And configure the following database connection

- **Database Type:** MariaDB (or MySQL)
- **Host:** `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`
- **Port:** `3306`
- **User:** `root`
- **Password:** Take it from [`.env`](https://github.com/EnAccess/micropowermanager/blob/main/docker/.env)
- **Database:** Leave empty if possible, as we will be interacting with multiple databases. Alternatively configure a seperate connection for each database. For example `micro_power_manager` and `DummyCompany_1`.

### Vue Developer Tools

For frontend developmenet it can be helpful to use the Vue DevTools.

- Install [Vue DevTools](https://devtools.vuejs.org/) in your local browser

## Troubleshooting

### Port errors

The local development setup uses ports `8000` and `8001`.
These are quite hardcoded into the application and cannot be changed easily.

**Problem:**
When running `docker compose up` the output contains errors messages related to ports being unavailable.

**Solution:**

Free up ports `8000` and `8001` by terminating any applications running on that ports.

### Docker build errors

**Problem:**
Certain Docker build errors can be related to interfering volumes that were created in previous runs of MPM.

**Solution:**

If you encounter Docker build errors, try removing orphaned containers by

```sh
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

### Containers get killed at runtime

**Problem:**

The containers builds fine, but when running them via `docker compose up` some of the containers get killed randomly without throwing an error.

The logs could contain something like this:

```sh
frontend-dev | killed
```

**Solution:**

Make sure your Docker's Virtual Machine (VM) has enough resources.
For example through [setting on Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/settings/).

We recommend the following settings

- CPU: 4 or more
- Memory: 4GB or more
- Disk: 50GB or more
