**Note: The pages that contain only a ``List of X`` and a ``Add new X``
button without any other key feature are not explained below.**

Clusters Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is basically the whole overview of the business. It shows some quick
information like total revenue, registered meters and the number of
registered clusters.

There are also more sections; 1. **Financial overview:** That breaks the
total revenue to Mini-Grid level. The manager can see/analyse each
Mini-Grid with that. 2. **Cluster Map:** The maps shows graphically
where the clusters are located. The clusters on the map are clickable
and forwards the manager to the next level dashboard **Cluster
Dashboard**

To register a new cluster find the red plus button on the right bottom
corner of the screen.
