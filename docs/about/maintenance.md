Maintenance
-----------

In some cases, it is wiser to use external resources to solve small
problems. Maintenance is exactly for that there. The maintenance users
are some experts who are not working for the company but works per
contract.

There is a form to create a **New Maintenance Request**. That page asks
the manager/admin about the job todo, the deadline for the task, the
person who is responsible to do that, and the price for the task. The
created task will be sent out to the external person via SMS. The
created maintenance job/task is also saved as a ticket. The gain by
saving that task as a ticket is, in case of a problem the person who is
assigned to that job can reply to the initial SMS. The incoming SMS will
automatically add to the ticket as a response.
