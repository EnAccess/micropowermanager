Meters
------

The ``Meters`` link on the sidebar loads a list that contains all
registered meters with some additional details such as its serial
number, assigned tariff, etc.. The search area on the page searches in
``serial_number`` and ``tariff name``.

By clicking on a meter in the list, a new ``meter detail`` page will be
loaded. This page, contains ``basic information``, ``meter details``,
and ``meter transactions``. If the meter can send its usage data it also
shows it in an additional ``meter reading`` section. The
``Basic Information`` section contains the total revenue that the meter
made, the owner, when the last payment occurs, and the registration
date. ``Meter Details`` are meter specified details such as the
manufacturer name, the serial number, assigned tariff, and its
connection type. ``Meter transactions`` is a basic list that contains
all transactions that hit the meter.
