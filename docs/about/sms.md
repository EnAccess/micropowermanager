Sms
---

Sms is the key communication infrastructure. It is used by
``Transactions`` and ``Maintenance``. But what if the company wants to
send some inform their customers about something like an unplanned
electricity cut. That is the reason why ``Sms``\ is listed in the
sidebar as an extra service.

The manager/admin can send SMS's to a specific Mini-Grid, to a specific
customer group/type or single customers.
