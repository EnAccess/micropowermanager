# Targets (Sidebar)

By clicking on `Targets` in the sidebar will load a page with already
set targets. The list shows only the key fields of each target. To see
the details of a target, click on the `Expand` button.

To add a **new Target** just click on the `New Target` on the right top
side. After clicking on that button, a new page will be loaded. Firstly
the manager/admin should assign a Cluster or a Mini-Grid. Then,
the date until that target is valid should be selected.

When these two steps are done; Its time to define our target with some
fields like `New connections`, `Revenue per Month`,\... None of these
fields are marked as required. That means the manager/admin is free to
enter or not to enter a value for each goal.
