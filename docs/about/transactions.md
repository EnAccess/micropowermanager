Transactions
------------

The page contains two main sections.

1. The comparison section; gives a quick overview of the situation. That
   section contains; Total incoming transactions, Confirmed
   Transactions, Cancelled Transactions, and the Revenue. The part which
   makes that information a bit interesting is the availability of
   comparison. The manager/admin can compare the day with; yesterday,
   same day last week, or the current week with last week or the current
   month with last month.

2. A basic list with incoming transactions. The list has an advanced
   filtering option instead of a basic search as in other pages.

By clicking on a Transaction, the ``Transaction detail`` page will load.
The detail page contains the ``Mobile Provider-specific data``,
``Basic Data``, ``Sent Sms``, and ``Transaction Processing``.

**Mobile Money Provider-specific data:** The name of the provider and
the transaction details. This information is required by the mobile
money provider in case of an issue.

**Transaction Processing:** A detailed list that shows how the incoming
money is been used by the system. Ex: 100$ for Energy, 20$ for Access
Rate, and 400$ for Milling Machine Rate Payment.
