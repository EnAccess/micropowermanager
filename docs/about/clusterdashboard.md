Cluster Dashboard
-----------------

The cluster dashboard is built similar to the clusters dashboard. There
are small informative boxes at the top of the screen. The financial
overview and the map are based on Mini-Grids instead of clusters.

There are two new sections available; 1. Revenue Analysis: That is the
place where all targets of MiniGrids are shown together. 2. Revenue
Trends: That is a chart that breaks down the revenue to customer groups.
