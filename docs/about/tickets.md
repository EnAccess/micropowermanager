Tickets
-------

MPManager is using `Trello <https://trello.com>`__ as a ticketing
platform. All tickets are basically Trello cards. The database is only
holding references to the tickets. The ticketing system aims to resolve
requests and complaints from customers as quickly as possible. It is
important to assign a ticket to the correct category to maintain tickets
easily. Therefore, there are some ticket categories. To add/ list
category please click on ``Categories`` that is listed under ``Tickets``
in the sidebar.

Adding User to Ticketing System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As already mentioned, the ticketing system is using Trello. To be able
to assign tickets internally, all the staff has to be registered on
`Trello <https://trello.com>`__. The user name is been used to associate
the Trello user to MPManager users.

To add a user click on ``Users`` in the list below ``Tickets``. It will
ask you the ``Ticketing System Tag``. That is the name that begins with
an **@** in the Trello user profile.
