# SMS/Messages

SMS is the key communication infrastructure.
It is used during `Transactions` and `Maintenance` requests.
Headquarter staff can therefore send SMS to customers, agents and service providers via the website interface.
Furthermore, it can also be used by the company to reach out to its entire (or part of its) customer base, in instances such as wanting to inform on a specific event (such a planned/unplanned electricity cut in case of mini-grid operation, or a marketing campaign).
That is the reason why `SMS` is listed in the sidebar as an extra service.

The manager/admin can send SMS's to the customers of a specific Mini-Grid, to a specific customer group/type or single customers.
