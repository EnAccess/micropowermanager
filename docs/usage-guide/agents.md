# Agents

Agents are company staff that are on site (or close to the site) and are able to support customers with tasks such as token generation (in exchange for cash payments), selling appliances, report customer issues to the company headquarters, etc.

Agents require the apps to do their work (see [Android apps](/usage-guide/android-apps)).

The user can register a new Agent on the MPM account by going to the "Agents" menu and then pressing on “+”.

The defined log in credentials by the user are then to be shared with the Agent, for them to be able to use the Agent account.
For more information on how to generate and manage tickets, see [Tickets](/usage-guide/tickets).

## Agent Commission Types

Agents receive cash from customers on site.
An agent's outstanding balance is the money it owes the company (i.e. it is the money it has collected on behalf of the company and has to transfer accordingly).

The "risk balance" is the maximum amount of money that an agent can collect before it has to transfer the money to the company.
When that balance is reached, agents will not be able to collect money anymore (generate tokens) or sell appliances (his account on the app will not work. So, when the agent sends the balance money to the company, then headquarters has to manually adjust the outstanding balance by that agent through MPM desktop.
This is done by creating a “receipt” on the specific agent’s profile.
When that receipt is created, balance of agent is removed/decreased to 0.

Agents are paid on a commission-basis. There are 2 commission types:

- **Energy commission:** % of the energy transaction that is kept by the agent. Sample says 0.1 = 0.1%).
- **Appliance commission:** % of the appliance value that is kept by the agent. Sample says 0.1 = 0.1%).

## Assigning or changing the commission of an agent

1. Create a commission type under Agent --> Commission type (click on the ":heavy_plus_sign:" button at the top right corner).
2. You either create a new agent, or you go to the page of the specific agent for which you want to change the commission type.
3. If you create a new agent, you select the commission type you want form the drop box.
4. If you edit it from an existing agent, you go to the agent, press the “pencil” drawing  commission field, and select from the dropdown.
