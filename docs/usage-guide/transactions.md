# Transactions

The "Transactions" menu includes a list of all transactions (regardless of purpose/device/appliance).

The page contains two main sections:

1. The comparison section; gives a quick overview of the situation.
   That section contains: Total incoming transactions, Confirmed Transactions, Cancelled Transactions, and the Revenue
   The part which makes that information interesting is the availability of comparison.
   The manager/admin can compare the day with; yesterday, same day last week, or the current week with last week or the current month with last month.

2. A basic list with incoming transactions.
   The list has an advanced filtering option instead of a basic search as in other pages.

By clicking on a Transaction, the `Transaction detail` page will load.
The detail page contains the `Mobile Provider-specific data`,`Basic Data`, `Sent Sms`, and `Transaction Processing`.

**Mobile Money Provider-Specific Information:** The name of the provider and the transaction details
This information is required by the mobile money provider in case of an issue.

**Transaction Processing:** A list and pie chart that shows how the incoming money from that customer has been used by MicroPowerManager system.
For example: a payment of UGX 20,000 is split in UGX 3,000 for mini-grid electricity, UGX 2,000 for mini-grid electricity Access Rate (if appliable), and UGX 15,000 for the repayment/instalment of a milling machine (appliance).
