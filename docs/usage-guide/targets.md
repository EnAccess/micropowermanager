# Targets

A target can be assigned to a whole cluster or for a single Mini-Grid.
The important thing by assigning a target is;

If the target is assigned to a cluster, the cluster manager will see only that target on the cluster dashboard.
However, if a single Mini-Grid or all Mini-Grids in a cluster has a defined target, the manager will see the calculated sum of these targets.

Example: Cluster 1 has following Mini-Grids; MG-1 MG-2 and MG-3

| #               | MG-1 | MG-2 | MG-3 |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| New Connections | 100  | 200  | 500  |

The result of the cluster overview page would be 800 for expected new
connections.

## Creating targets

By clicking on `Targets` in the sidebar, a page with the already set targets will be loaded.
The list shows only the key fields of each target.
To see the details of a target, click on the `Expand` button.

To add a **new Target** just click on the ":heavy_plus_sign:" on the right top side.
After clicking on that button, a new page will be loaded.
Firstly, the manager/admin should assign a Cluster or a Mini-Grid.
Then, the date by when that target should be accomplished should be selected.

When these two steps are done, it is time to define our target with some fields like `New connections`, `Revenue per Month`,\...
None of these fields are marked as required.
That means the manager/admin is free to enter or not a value for each goal.
