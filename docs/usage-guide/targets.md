# Targets

A target can be assigned to a whole cluster or for a single Mini-Grid.
The important thing by assigning a target is;

If the target is assigned to a cluster, the manager will see only that
target on the cluster dashboard. However, if a single Mini-Grid or all
Mini-Grids in a cluster has a defined target. The manager will see the
calculated sum of these targets.

Example: Cluster 1 has following Mini-Grids; MG-1 MG-2 and MG-3

| #               | MG-1 | MG-2 | MG-3 |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| New Connections | 100  | 200  | 500  |

The result of the cluster overview page would be 800 for expected new
connections.

## Creating targets

By clicking on `Targets` in the sidebar will load a page with already
set targets. The list shows only the key fields of each target. To see
the details of a target, click on the `Expand` button.

To add a **new Target** just click on the `New Target` on the right top
side. After clicking on that button, a new page will be loaded. Firstly
the manager/admin should assign a Cluster or a Mini-Grid. Then,
the date until that target is valid should be selected.

When these two steps are done; Its time to define our target with some
fields like `New connections`, `Revenue per Month`,\... None of these
fields are marked as required. That means the manager/admin is free to
enter or not to enter a value for each goal.
