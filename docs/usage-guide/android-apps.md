## Customer Registration App

New customer profiles can be created via this app or through the website directly. The Customer Registration App enables the user/Agent to register new SHS and e-bike devices. The Agent/user has to first install the app by following the steps outlined on the “Get Started with MPM” section. The app can be accessed using the log in credentials provided to the Agent/user by the company management.

Once logged in, the user should go to “Add Customer” on the bottom right of the screen and introduce the relevant customer data. Kindly note that the “Meter Type”, “Tariff”, “Connection Group”, “Connection Type” and “Sub Connection Type” fields are only relevant for mini-grid customers (not SHS and e-bike devices). The device’s ID as per the manufacturer should be inserted on the field “Serial Number”. This will serve as the device identified to receive payments for that device.

The app also enables the user to access the customer list for the systems for which it is in charge (see bottom left of the screenshot below).

## Agent/Merchant App

The purpose of the Agent app is to:

1. **Generate electricity tokens** for registered devices (in case the customer cannot use mobile money, it can rely on a local Agent to generate a token on his/her behalf after a cash payment). The Agent hands in the generated token by the app, which the customer can then use to top-up the applicable device (electricity meter, SHS or e-bike). To generate a token, follow these steps:

   a) Select the “Customers” Menu on the Agent/Merchant app

   b) Select the customer for which a token should be generated

   c) Click on the “+” at the bottom right of the skin

   d) Insert the currency amount the customer has paid (which should be converted into a token)

   e) Press “Continue” and then “Confirm”.

   f) The app will give you the token, which you then share with the customer.

## SMS Gateway App

Kindly be aware that this app has created issues with service providers. The privacy settings and new features of Android may interfere/block the proper functioning of this app. These issues are pending to be resolved.

The purpose of the app is to enable SMS-sending from and to the MPM website interface as well as to be able to send SMS to your customer portfolio through the same website. For this feature to work, the SMS Gateway App must be installed on the applicable mobile phone (following the steps outlined on the “Get Started with MPM”). Click then on the Copy Device Token and share the token with the headquarters staff. The users with access to the MPM account’s website interface can then insert the device token under the “Settings” page, thereby interlinking this phone with the MPM account.
