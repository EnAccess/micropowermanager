# Terminology

Here we describe the terminology used in MicroPowerManager:

| Term                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Device                        | Devices are the assets that can be managed with MicroPowerManager that require the integration with a third-party token generation system (API integration). At the moment, the 3 device categories are mini-grid electricity pre-paid meters, solar home systems (SHS) and e-bikes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Device Registration Hierarchy | Every newly registered device has to be assigned to a village, mini-grid project and cluster. One or more villages may belong to the same mini-grid project. And one or more mini-grid projects may belong to the same cluster. Therefore, defining the village / mini-grid project / cluster layers precedes device registration on MicroPowerManager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Village                       | Name of the town where the registered devices are located. When user wants to create a new cluster and mini-grid project, it is required to first create at least one village on MicroPowerManager. What is not allowed/possible on MicroPowerManager is to have a village in a cluster without pre-assigning it to a mini-grid project (even if the devices are not mini-grid electricity meters).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Mini-Grid                     | It is an off-grid electricity distribution network that includes small/medium-scale electricity generation. The way MicroPowerManager is currently developed, a mini-grid must be defined (together with a cluster and village, see below) in order to register new devices on MicroPowerManager (whether they are mini-grid connections, SHSs or e-bikes).. Each mini-grid customer has its own electricity pre-paid meter. Customers top up via mobile money or cash payments (to a company Agent) their accounts. MicroPowerManager uses the received money to generate and share an electricity token to the customer. Customer introduces the token to its electricity meter and can then consume electricity. |
| Cluster                       | The area that covers a geography of grouped devices (whether mini-grids, SHSs or e-bikes). In order to register new mini-grids, SHSs or e-bikes as devices on your MicroPowerManager account, you will also have to define a cluster and village (to which the devices are assigned to).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Solar Home System             | Stand-alone photovoltaic systems supplying power for lighting and appliances to remote off-grid households. In MicroPowerManager, SHSs are paid for by customers via pay-as-you-go schemes (monthly instalments).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Appliance                     | These are assets that require electrical power to be operated. MicroPowerManager enables the creation of new appliance types and the management of appliances’ re-payment schemes (such as mills, water pumps, fridges, TVs, etc.). Appliances are pre-financed by the company and re-paid by customers on a pay-as-you-go basis (monthly instalments). The difference with SHSs and e-bike (devices) is that appliances do not require tokens nor API integration for their usage. They can be created by a mini-grid admin (from the website interface) and can be sold by a third-party (Agent).                                                                                                                 |
| Users                         | Anyone with log in credentials to access the company’s account on MicroPowerManager. This differs from **Agents** and from **service maintenance providers**, who can only access the Agent app on their phone (not the website interface).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Agent                         | A company employee located on-site that serves as a customer support point. Common tasks of an Agent are to gather customer complaints or generate mini-grid electricity tokens on behalf of customers (who, for instance, do not use mobile money). Agents’ log in credentials allow them to use the Customer Registration and Agent apps, but not to access the company MicroPowerManager account on the website interface. You can register as many Agents as you want on your MicroPowerManager website account (see [Agents](agents) for further information). Agents can only perform their work with the mentioned apps.                                                                                     |
| Service Maintenance Provider  | These are persons that may not necessarily be your company employees but that you rely on on a case-by-case basis to resolve technical issues on site. Having registered them on your MicroPowerManager account allows your to directly notify them via SMS from the MicroPowerManager website interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Customer                      | It defines individual clients and businesses registered in MicroPowerManager. Devices are assigned to customers. A customer may own more than one device and appliance).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Meter                         | A pre-paid energy meter that works with an STS-Token. These are only applicable for mini-grid connections/customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Transaction                   | Incoming payments from customers. Transactions serve both the re-payment of appliances as well as the activation of a token generation (to continue using one of the devices). Each payment for a device is linked to the device number (separate transactions must be performed by a customer to top up a mini-grid electricity meter, SHS or e-bike).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Ticket                        | It is the place where customer problems, complaints, and demands are collected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Tariff                        | The combination of energy(kWh) price and the fixed price (access rate). It is applicable only to mini-grid connections/customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
