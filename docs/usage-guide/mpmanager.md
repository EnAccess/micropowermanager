## Clusters Dashboard

It is basically the whole overview of the business. It shows some quick
information like total revenue, registered meters and the number of
registered clusters.

There are also more sections

1. **Financial overview:** That breaks the
   total revenue to Mini-Grid level. The manager can see/analyse each
   Mini-Grid with that.
2. **Cluster Map:** The maps shows graphically
   where the clusters are located. The clusters on the map are clickable
   and forwards the manager to the next level dashboard **Cluster
   Dashboard**

To register a new cluster find the red plus button on the right bottom
corner of the screen.
