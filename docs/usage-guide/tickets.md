# Tickets

The "Tickets" ("List") menu shows a list of the company’s open and closed tickets.
The "Tickets" ("Categories") menu enables the user to create a new ticket category (for example, installation issue, payment issue, software issue, etc).
This enables the company to categorize/organize its different tickets.

To create a new ticket, however, following steps must be done (depending on whether the ticket is to resolve a customer-specific issue or rather a system-level technical problem):

1. **Ticket for a specific customer:**

   a) If the customer calls the company headquarters, it makes sense to generate the ticket directly from the website interface.
   Choose the customer from the "Customer" menu and create a ticket.

   b) If the customer reports an issue to an Agent on site, it makes sense for the Agent to generate the ticket via the Agent App (see [Android Apps](android-apps)).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Agents at present can create tickets but cannot be assigned tickets (unlike maintenance service providers).
   > This may be adjusted with additional development work or by first registering the Agent as well as a "Maintenance Service Provider" in MicroPowerManager.

   The newly created ticket will now be shown on both that customer’s page as well as on the "Ticket" menu.

2. **Tickets as System Maintenance Requests**: kindly check [Maintenance](maintenance) below.
