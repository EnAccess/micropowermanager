# Cluster Dashboard

The cluster dashboard has 3 sections. There is first a snapshot of small informative boxes at the top of the screen including data on number of registered clusters, total customers in portfolio, total connected meters and total revenues generated in the last 30 days. Secondly, the financial overview includes the revenue analysis. Thirdly, the map visually depicts where the connections/mini-grids are located.

There are two new sections available; 1. Revenue Analysis: That is the
place where all targets of MiniGrids are shown together. 2. Revenue
Trends: That is a chart that breaks down the revenue to customer groups.
