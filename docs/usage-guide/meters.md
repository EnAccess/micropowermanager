# Meters

The “Meter” menu is a list of all registered electricity meter devices on the MPM account. It is only applicable for companies managing mini-grid customers (if a company only has SHS and/or e-bike devices, this page will be blank).

The “Meter” menu shows, in tabular form, the meter serial number, the tariff applying to that meter, the meter manufacturer and the meter model/type. Upon clicking on a given device number, the accumulated meter transactions are shown.

As outlined on the “Setting up your MPM company account” above, registering a new meter device must be done via the Customer Registration App. What can be done from the MPM website interface is re-assign existing meters from customer to customer.
