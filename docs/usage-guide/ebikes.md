# E-bikes

This is the section listing all e-bike devices registered under your company account.
It is the analogous section to the "Meter" and "Solar Home Systems" menus for mini-grid connections and SHS devices, respectively.

E-bike devices can be registered via the Customer Registration App (see [Customer Registration App](android-apps#customer-registration-app)) or directly through the website interface (Select "E-bike" menu on the left sidebar --> Click ":heavy_plus_sign:" --> introduce device data as requested.)
