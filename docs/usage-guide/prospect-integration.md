### Step 7: API Configuration Details

After selecting your connection type, you'll see the API configuration page with:

- **API Endpoint**: The URL where you'll POST your data
- **Documentation Link**: Access to full API documentation
- **Authorization Details**: Bearer token for authentication

![API Configuration](images/prospect-api-configuration.png)

**Key Information Displayed:**

- POST URL: `https://demo.prospect.energy/api/in/installations`
- Authorization Header: `Bearer 99b90db993b83c303e4f7511977a8d46`
- API Documentation: `https://demo.prospect.energy/api-docs/index.html`

### Step 8: Activate Data Source

1. Click **Next** to proceed to activation
1. Check the activation checkbox to enable the data source
1. Review the data source configuration:
   - **State**: Active/Inactive status
   - **Data Category**: installations
   - **Organization**: Your organization details
   - **Secret**: API authentication token

![Data Source Activation](images/prospect-datasource-activation.png)

## Configuring the MPM Integration

Now that you have obtained the authorization token and API endpoint from Prospect, you need to configure the Prospect plugin in MicroPowerManager.

### Step 9: Enable Prospect Plugin

1. Log in to your MicroPowerManager instance
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Configuration** → **Plugins**
3. Locate the **Prospect** plugin
4. Enable the plugin by toggling the switch to the "On" position

![Enable Prospect Plugin](images/prospect-enable-plugin.png)

### Step 10: Configure Plugin Settings

After enabling the plugin, you need to configure it with the credentials obtained from Prospect:

1. Navigate to the **Overview** page (this is typically in the Prospect plugin section)
2. Enter the **Authorization Token** that you obtained from Step 8 of the Prospect platform
3. Specify the **BASE_URL** - this should be the API endpoint URL shown in Step 7 (e.g., `https://demo.prospect.energy/api/v1/in/installations`)
4. **Note**: Currently, we are working with installations data. More data types will be added in future updates
5. Click **Save** to store your configuration

![Configure Token and BASE_URL](images/prospect-configure-settings.png)

### Step 11: Configure Synchronization Schedule

Set how often you want MPM to sync data to Prospect:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** page within the Prospect plugin
2. Configure the synchronization frequency:
   - **Hourly** - Syncs data every hour
   - **Daily** - Syncs data once per day
   - **Weekly** - Syncs data once per week
   - **Yearly** - Syncs data once per year
3. Choose the appropriate schedule based on your needs
4. Save your configuration

![Configure Schedule](images/prospect-configure-schedule.png)

## How It Works

Once configured, the Prospect plugin will:

1. Automatically extract installation data from your MPM database
2. Create CSV files containing the installation data
3. Push the data to Prospect using the configured API endpoint and authentication token
4. Run according to your specified schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, or yearly)

The integration handles all data synchronization automatically, so you don't need to manually export or import data.

   - Check that the API token and BASE_URL are correctly configured
   - Ensure the token hasn't expired
   - Verify network connectivity between MPM and Prospect

2. **Data Not Appearing in Prospect**
   - Check MPM logs for any sync errors
   - Verify that there is installation data available in your MPM database
   - Confirm that the schedule is correctly configured and the sync has run
   - Check Prospect platform for any incoming data errors

3. **Configuration Issues**
   - Ensure the BASE_URL matches the API endpoint from your Prospect datasource
   - Verify the authorization token is correct and up-to-date
   - Check that you have appropriate permissions to configure plugins

### Checking Sync Status

You can monitor the sync status by:
