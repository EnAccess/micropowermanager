Targets (Sidebar)
-----------------

By clicking on ``Targets`` in the sidebar will load a page
with already set targets. The list shows only the key fields of each
target. To see the details of a target, click on the ``Expand`` button.

To add a **new Target** just click on the ``New Target`` on the right
top side. After clicking on that button, a new page will be loaded.
Firstly the manager/admin should assign a Cluster or a Mini-Grid (The
difference is already explained
`here <#Information-before-using-MPManager>`__). Then, the date until
that target is valid should be selected.

When these two steps are done; Its time to define our target with some
fields like ``New connections``, ``Revenue per Month``,... None of these
fields are marked as required. That means the manager/admin is free to
enter or not to enter a value for each goal.
