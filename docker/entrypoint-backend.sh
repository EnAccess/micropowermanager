# MicroPowerManager may run in different environments that handle storage
# differently:
#
# For example:
#   - Local dev: Docker host bind mounts for source code
#   - Local dev or simple production: Docker volumes for storage
#   - Kubernetes production: Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for storage
#
# These option behaves differently when it comes to directory structure and
# permissions:
#   - PVCs and empty Docker volumes start out completely empty,
#     so Laravel’s required "storage/" subdirectories won’t exist.
#   - Host bind mounts may carry host system permissions,
#     which often don’t match the webserver (www-data) user inside the
#.    container.
#
# Since Laravel requires a specific storage structure with correct permissions
# (for logs, caches, sessions, views, etc.), we bootstrap it here at startup.
# This guarantees a consistent runtime environment regardless of how the volume
# is mounted.
